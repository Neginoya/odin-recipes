        Malasadas are Hawaii's version of a doughnut. Malasadas do have Portuguese origins and can be considered more of a Portuguese dessert, but have become 
        widely popular in Hawaii which has introduced many to this delicious mix between doughnut and beignet(me included). Unlike a doughnut they have no hole 
        and are not glazed, but are dusted with sugar and can be filled.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1/4 cups whole milk</li>
        <li>1 packet active dry yeast</li>
        <li>1/4 cup and 1 tablespoon sugar divided</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>1/2 cup softened butter</li>
        <li>1 teaspoonsalt</li>
        <li>4 1/2 cups flour</li>
        <li>2 quarts oil for frying</li>
        <li>granulated sugar for coating</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat milk to 110F-115F. Take your yeast an 1 tablespoon of sugar to add to the warmed milk to activate the yeast. Lightly stir and let sit for about 5 
            minutes until it foams at the top.</li>
        <li>Beat the eggs, butter, salt, and 1/4 cup of sugar, mixing with the milk/yeast mixture. Add in 2 1/4 cup of flour to the mixing bowl and mix until 
            combined. Once combined, mix in the rest of your flour until a dough forms. Knead this dough until it pulls away from the sides of the bowl. 
            The dough should be slightly sticky, but you can add small amounts of flour at a time and mix if the dough is too sticky to work with.</li>
        <li>Form the dough into a ball and place in a large greased bowl. Cover this bowl with plastic wrap and let rise at room temperature for about 1 
            hour until the dough doubles in size.</li>
        <li>Place your dough onto a well-floured surface and cut into 16 equal pieces. Fold each piece into a ball shape being careful not to work each 
            ball too much. Flatten each ball into a slightly fat disc shape, and place each piece on a small square piece of parchment paper. Cover the pieces 
            and leave to rise for another 45 minutes to 1 hour until they have puffed up.</li>
        <li>Shortly before your dough discs have finished rising, heat up your oil in a deep fryer or dutch oven to 350F. On the side set up a place for your 
            malasadas to cool off once finished frying.</li>
        <li>When your oil has come to temp, add your malasadas to the oil, only 1-3 at a time. Fry each piece for 1:30 - 2 minutes flipping once the bottom 
            appears golden. Once fully cooked remove and place on your cooling station. Let each malasada cool for a couple minutes.</li>
        <li>Once your malasadas are cool enough to handle, roll in sugar until they are well coated and enjoy!</li>
