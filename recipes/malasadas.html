        Malasadas are Hawaii's version of a doughnut. Malasadas do have Portuguese origins and can be considered more of a Portuguese dessert, but have become 
        widely popular in Hawaii which has introduced many to this delicious mix between doughnut and beignet(me included). Unlike a doughnut they have no hole 
        and are not glazed, but are dusted with sugar and can be filled.
