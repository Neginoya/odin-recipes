        <li>155ml full fat whole milk</li>
        <li>8g fine salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h4><strong>Dough</strong></h4>
    <ul>
        <li>310g bread flour</li>
        <li>40g sugar</li>
        <li>7g dried yeast</li>
        <li>30g salted butter, softened and cubed</li>
        <li>200g cold butter(cut into 8x25g pieces)</li>
        <li>flaked salt to garnish at end</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Firstly we are going to be making the tangzhong by whisking 14g of flour and 60ml of water in a saucepan heating gently on low heat until it 
            reaches 149F/65C. Gradually whisk in milk in a continuous stream, lastly adding the salt. You should be left with a paste that will add lots 
            of moisture to our dough.
        </li>
        <li>
            Have your stand mixer set on low speed with dough attachment. Place bread flour, sugar, and yeast in mixing bowl and whisk together. Pour in your 
            tangzhong and mix with spatula until mostly combined. Knead the dough on low speed for about a minute until the dough starts to come together.
        </li>
        <li>
            Drop in your butter one piece at a time while the mixer is still going. Increase the speed to medium and knead for 15-20 minutes. Check dough for

            is healthy enough to continue.
        </li>
        <li>
            Shape into a ball and place in a large greased vessel and cover with plastic wrap or a damp towel for your first proof. Place in a warm spot(I 
            use my oven with the oven light on and a measuring cup full of hot water next to it) and wait for the dough to double in size(about an hour).
        </li>
        <li>
            Once doubled in size, divide the dough into 8 pieces about 75g each. Shape into balls and cover with plastic wrap or a towel allowing it to rise 
            for about another 20 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Roll each piece into a carrot shape by focusing primarily on rolling one end thinner. Cover once again to rise for another 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>
            Take a rolling pin and roll out the fatter side away from you while holding the narrow end, gently pulling it towards you while you roll it out. 
            The wide end should be about 4 inches in width and the length of the dough should be about 15 inches long. Repeat with each piece of dough.
        </li>
        <li>
            Take your chilled 25g butter cubes placing each one on the wider end of each dough. Roll up the dough tightly to create the look of a croissant.
            Take a large baking tray lined with parchment paper, and place each dough piece on the tray with about a couple inches of space between them. 
            Cover once again and and allow the dough pieces to rise again in a warm place for 1 hour.
        </li>
        <li>
            Each dough piece should look puffy at this point, Preheat your oven to 410F with a tray filled with 1 inch of water at the lowest shelf in the oven.
            Spray each roll about 20 times with water and sprinkle with flaked salt. Bake for 19 minutes turning the tray around 15 minutes into baking time. Once done, 
            take out tray and allow the rolls to cool for 5-10 minutes, these are best enjoyed once they have cooled enough to eat!
